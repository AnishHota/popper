# Quickstart

_Popper_ is a convention for organizing an academic article's 
artifacts following a DevOps approach. For an in-depth description on 
the rationale behind Popper, you can read this article.

A [step-by-step guide](./from_scratch.md) describes how to "Popperize" 
an experiment and manuscript. Additionally, the following is a list of 
examples on how to bootstrap a Popper project (repository) in specific 
domains:

  * [Data Science](Popper-Data-Science)
  * [High Performance Computing (HPC)](Popper-HPC)
  * [Mathematical Sciences](Popper-Math-Science)

A list of Popperized papers that have been submitted for publication 
can be found [here](https://falsifiable.us/pubs).

# Popper

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/systemslab/popper](https://badges.gitter.im/systemslab/popper.svg)](https://gitter.im/falsifiable-us/popper?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Popper is a convention for generating reproducible papers. We're working with scientists in genomics, weather prediction, playable media, distributed systems (and adding more domains) to have them use DevOps tools and follow software engineering best-practices when they implement experiments associated to academic articles. Our goal is to lower the barriers for collaboration and the sharing of knowledge.

## Getting Started

This repository contains:

  * A [CLI tool](popper/) to help bootstrap research articles that 
    adhere to the convention.
  * [Documentation](http://popper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) about the 
    convention.
  * [Experiment re-usable templates](templates/) that can be retrieved using the
    CLI tool (or by cloning this repo).

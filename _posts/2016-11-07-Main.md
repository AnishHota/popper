_Popper_ is a convention for conducting experiments and writing 
academic article's following a 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) approach that allows 
researchers to automate the re-execution and validation of an 
experiment.

Over the last decade software engineering and systems administration 
communities (also referred to as DevOps) have developed sophisticated 
techniques and strategies to ensure “software reproducibility”, i.e. 
the reproducibility of software artifacts and their behavior using 
versioning, dependency management, containerization, orchestration, 
monitoring, testing and documentation. The key idea behind the Popper 
Convention is to manage every experiment in computation and data 
exploration as a software project, using tools and services that are 
readily available now and enjoy wide popularity. By doing so, 
scientific explorations become reproducible with the same convenience, 
efficiency, and scalability as software reproducibility while fully 
leveraging continuing improvements to these tools and services. Rather 
than mandating a particular set of tools, the convention only expects 
components of an experiment to be scripted (see @Fig:devops-approach). 
There are two main goals for Popper:

 1. It should be usable in as many research projects as possible, 
    regardless of their domain.
 2. It should abstract underlying technologies without requiring a 
    strict set of tools, making it possible to apply it on multiple 
    toolchains.

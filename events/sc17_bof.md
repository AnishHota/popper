---------------------------  | -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 12:15         |  &nbsp; **Introduction**. Brief introduction to scope the topic of the BoF. In short, our goal is to focus on replicability / re-usability of artifacts associated to experiments (scientific explorations).
 12:20         |  &nbsp; **Lightning Talks**. Kate Keahey, Carlos Maltzahn and Ivo Jimenez will give a 5-minute lightning talk each, describing their point of view on this topic.
 12:35         |  &nbsp; **Discussion**. What domain-specific tools do you use? Can they be scripted? Are you scripting your explorations? What works? What needs improvement? How do we incentivize the generation of replicable experiments?
 1:05          |  &nbsp; **Survey**. Attendees answer a brief [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hH0c2FdwRFBq-czz9xoiXsbhppXQfEmWty7eBYqUWXs)

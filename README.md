Popper is a convention for generating reproducible papers. This 
repository contains:

  * A [CLI tool](popper/) to help bootstrap research articles that 
    adhere to the convention by re-using [experiment templates](https://github.com/ivotron/popper-templates).
  * [Documentation](https://github.com/ivotron/popper/wiki/Getting-Started) 
    about the convention.
  * [Experiment templates](templates/) that can be retrieved using the
    CLI tool (or by cloning this repo).

We are currently working with researchers in many scientific domains
to include more experiments to this repository. If you are interested
in contributing one but are not certain on how to start, please feel
free to [email us](mailto:ivo@cs.ucsc.edu),
[chat](https://gitter.im/systemslab/popper) or [open an
issue](https://github.com/systemslab/popper-templates/issues/new).

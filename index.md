_Popper_ is a convention for conducting experiments and writing 
academic article's following a 
[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) approach that allows 
researchers to automate the re-execution and validation of an 
experiment. To learn more about Popper you can:

  * Read the [overview][overview] or our [blog][blog].
  * Download our [publications][pubs].
  * [Email us](mailto:ivo@cs.ucsc.edu), 
    [chat](https://gitter.im/systemslab/popper) or [open an 
    issue](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/issues/new).
  * Visit our [wiki page][quick-start], where you can learn how to:
      * Follow the convention to generate [Popper-compliant 
        experiments][from-scratch].
      * Use the [Popper-CLI][cli] tool to obtain existing experiment 
        templates.
      * [Display the status][badge] of an experiment using a badge.

We are currently working with researchers in many domains to extend 
our [templates repository](https://github.com/systemslab/popper) with 
more experiments. If you are interested in contributing but are not 
certain on how to start, please feel free to contact us.

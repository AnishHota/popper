_Popper_ is a convention for organizing an academic article's artifacts 
following a DevOps approach. For a high-level description on Popper, 
check the [[Intro to Popper]].

## Guides and Examples

[This step-by-step guide](Popper-From-Scratch) describes how to 
"Popperize" an experiment and manuscript. Additionally, the following 
is a list of examples on how to bootstrap a Popper project 
(repository) in specific domains:

  * [Data Science](Popper-Data-Science)
  * [High Performance Computing (HPC)](Popper-HPC)
  * [Mathematical Sciences](Popper-Math-Science)

<!--
  * [Distributed Systems](Popper-Distributed-Systems)
  * [Games and Playable Media](Popper-Gaming)
 -->

A list of Popperized papers that have been submitted for publication 
can be found [here](Popper-Examples).

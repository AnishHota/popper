Popper is a convention and CLI tool for generating reproducible papers. This repository contains:

  * A [CLI tool](popper/) to help bootstrap research articles that 
    adhere to the convention.
  * [Documentation](http://popper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) about the 
    convention.
  * [Experiment re-usable templates](templates/) that can be retrieved using the
    CLI tool (or by cloning this repo).

## Installation

To get started with the CLI tool, download Popper from  [popper/releases](https://github.com/systemslab/popper/releases). Note  that we have only binaries for macOS and Linux. Once downloaded, uncompress and place the binary in a folder that is  included in your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/bin`). For Windows, we recommend using Popper with the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10). 

To get an overview and list of commands check out the command line 
help:

```bash
popper help
```

### Abstract

This BoF is for HPC community members who want to make sharing and 
re-executing scientific experiments more practical. As a starting 
point, we will introduce the Popper Protocol (http://falsifiable.us), 
a set of guidelines for managing scientific explorations as software 
projects. We will moderate discussions, and conduct a survey among 
attendants on tools/services that can be used to “Popperize” 
scientific explorations, i.e. fully automate/document experiments by 
scripting all aspects of their execution/analysis and version-control 
their evolution using DevOps tools. Our goal: create a list of 
tool-chain templates that domain-specific communities can use to 
incentivize researchers/students to generate easily 
re-executable/shareable experiments.

---------------------------  | -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 12:15         |  &nbsp; **Introduction**. Brief introduction to scope the topic of the BoF. In short, our goal is to focus on replicability / re-usability of artifacts associated to experiments (scientific explorations).
 12:25         |  &nbsp; **Lightning Talks**. Kate Keahey, Carlos Maltzahn and Ivo Jimenez will give a 5-minute lightning talk each, describing their point of view on this topic.
 12:35         |  &nbsp; **Discussion**. What domain-specific tools do you use? Can they be scripted? Are you scripting your explorations? What works? What needs improvement? How do we incentivize the generation of replicable experiments?
 1:05          |  &nbsp; **Survey**. Attendees answer a brief [survey](http://bit.ly/practical_repro_survey){:target="_blank"}
